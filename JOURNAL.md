# June 4th: Designing the Schematic and PCB
So I've designed a hackpad before but I never finished it (I started it 24 hours before the deadline) so when starting the schematic and PCB, it didn't take too long. I finished pretty quickly, so all I need to do is finish CADing the case and configure the keys.

# June 11th: Designing the Case
~~I usually use Solidworks, however I hate running it on my laptop so I used OnShape.~~
So I used Solidworks to CAD my case because it's what I'm most familiar with. For my outline, I used the same vector I drew in Figma that I also used for my PCB.
