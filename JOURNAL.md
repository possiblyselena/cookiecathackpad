# June 4th: Designing the Schematic and PCB
So I've designed a hackpad before but I never finished it (I started it 24 hours before the deadline) so when starting the schematic and PCB, it didn't take too long. I finished pretty quickly, so all I need to do is finish CADing the case and configure the keys.

**Total time spent: 1 hour**

# June 11th: Designing the Case
~~I usually use Solidworks, however I hate running it on my laptop so I used OnShape.~~
So I used Solidworks to CAD my case because it's what I'm most familiar with. For my outline, I used the same vector I drew in Figma that I also used for my PCB. I made a top case and ~~bottom case~~ (It didn't save so I have to redo it next journal). I'm just going to glue the case together so I did not add any screw holes. Additionally, I did the firmware using KMK because my Solidworks wasn't working for a bit. I can't assemble it today, but all my parts are finished!

**Total time spent: 3 hours** (I was on call)

# June 12th: Finishing CADing 
I finished the bottom case and that's about it. I didn't have a lot of time to work on much more.
