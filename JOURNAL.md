# June 4th: Designing the Schematic and PCB
So I've designed a hackpad before but I never finished it (I started it 24 hours before the deadline) so when starting the schematic and PCB, it didn't take too long. I finished pretty quickly, so all I need to do is finish CADing the case and configure the keys.

# June 11th: Designing the Case
I used Solidworks to CAD my case because it's what I'm most familiar with. For my outline, I used the same vector I drew in Figma that I also used for my PCB. I made a top case and ~~bottom case~~ (It didn't save so I have to redo it next journal). I'm just going to glue the case together so I did not add any screw holes. Additionally, I did the firmware using KMK because my Solidworks wasn't working for a bit. I can't assemble it today, but all my parts are finished!

**Total time spent: 3 hours** (I was on call)

# June 12th: Finishing CADing 
I finished the bottom case and that's about it. I didn't have a lot of time to work on much more.

**Total time spent: 10 minutes**

# June 13th: Finished!
So, I would usually assemble this in Solidworks or alternativley OnShape, but my computer really hates both softwares right after I finished my parts. So, the best thing I can do is in TinkerCAD... Atleast it's a STL file and it works.
